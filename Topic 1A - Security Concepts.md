To be successful and credible you need to understand security in business from the ground up.
- **Information Security**
	- Refers to the protection of data and recourses from unauthorized access, attacks, theft or damage
	- Data may be vulnerable because of the way it is, stored, transferred or processed
	- Secure information has 3 properties according to the CIA triad:
		- Confidentiality
			- only those who are explicitly authorized may read the data
		- Integrity
			- Data is stored and transmitted as intended
			- modification of data is authorized
		- Availability
			- Information is readily accessible to those authorized to view or modify it
	- Another very important property of secure systems is Non-repudiation
		- A person cannot deny doing something such as creating modifying, or sending a recourse
- **Cyber Security Framework**
	- Cyber security refers specifically to provisioning secure processing hardware and software
	- Information security and cyber security can be classified as five functions
		- Identify
			- Develop secure policies and capabilities
			- Evaluate, risks, threats and vulnerabilities and recommend security controls to mitigate vulnerabilities
		- Protect
			- Procedure/develop, install, operate and decommission IT hardware and software assets
		- Detect
			- Perform on going, proactive, monitoring to ensure that controls are effective and capable of defending against new types of threats
		- Respond
			- Identify, analyze, contain and eradicate threats to systems and data security
		- Recover
			- Implement cyber security resilience to restore systems and data
- **Gap Analysis**
	- Each security function is associated with a number of goals or outcomes
	- Numerous categories and types of security controls
	- Cyber security framework guides the selection and configuration of controls
	- Frameworks save a company or organization from building security programs in a vacuum
	- Frameworks allow for an organization to make an objective statement of:
		- Their current capabilities
		- Target level capability
		- Prioritize investments to achieve that target
	- Gap analysis identifies how an organizations security systems deviate from those required or recommended by a framework
	- *Typically involve a third-party to perform the analysis*
- **Access Control**
	- Access control systems ensures that an information system meets the goals of the CIA triad
	- Governs how subjects may interact with objects
	- Modern access control systems are implemented as Identity and Access Management (IAM)
	- Consists of four main processes
		- Identification
			- Creating an account or ID that is unique to the user, device, or network
		- Authentication
			- Proving a subject is who it claims to be when accessing the resource
		- Authorization
			- Determining what rights subjects should have on recourses and enforcing those rights
		- Accounting
			- Tracking authorized usage of a resource
	- *Servers and protocols can be referred to as authentication, authorization and accounting*
	- *processes apply to both people and systems*
- **Review**
	- 1) What are the properties of a secure information processing system?
		- Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
	- 2) What term is best used to describe the property of a secure network where the sender cannot deny sending a message?
		- Non repudiation
	- 3) A company provides a statement of deviations from framework best practices to a regulator. What process was performed?
		- Gap analysis
	- 4) What process within an access control framework logs actions performed by a subject
		- Accounting
	- 5) Difference between authorization and authentication?
		- Authorization = granting a user account access to a resource
		- Authentication = protecting the validity of the user
	- 6) how does accounting provide non repudiation?
		- Each User is associated with a unique computer account
