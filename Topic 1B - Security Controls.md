- **Security control functional types**
	- Security controls can be defined by the function it performs
		- Preventative
			- Acts to eliminate or reduce the likelihood an attack can succeed
		- Detective
			- may not prevent or deter access but will identify and record an attempted or successful intrusion
		- Corrective

	- While most controls can be classified into the above, a few other types can define other cases
		- Directive
			- Enforces a rule or behavior, such as policy, best practice standard or standard operation procedure
		- Deterrent
			- May not physically or logically prevent access, but psychologically discourages an attacker from attempting an intrusion
		- Compensating
